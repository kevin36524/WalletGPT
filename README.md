### Get the code

- Clone `git clone https://github.com/kevin36524/WalletGPT` into a separate folder
    - Now replace your functions directory with the functions from this newly cloned repo.
      - Something like this `rm -rf myProject/functions; cp -r WalletGPT/functions myProject/.`
    - Now you can safely discard your cloned repo. `rm -rf WalletGPT`

- Update .env.local vars
    - Go to [APIs and Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) in google cloud.
    - You should see your OAuth 2.0 client-id open that
       - Update your authorized Redirect URIs and add
          - https://<your_cloud_function_base_URL>/oauthRedirect
    - Now update your .env.local vars with
       - clientID, clientSecret and your authorized Redirect URI you see above.
    - Now copy the .env.local to .env.default
- Run `npm run deploy`
- Test with [testRequests.http](functions/reference_stuff/testRequests.http).
    - Replace the base URL and test it out.

## Creating the GPT and hooking it up with your cloud functions.
Here are the high-level instructions. Please refer to [Part 5 - youtube video](https://youtu.be/-f-PnfsQTJw) for more details

### Create a GPT

- Login to your chatgpt plus account.
- Next go to [https://chat.openai.com/create](https://chat.openai.com/create)
    - Write a GPT to help me keep a journal for my expences and income.
       I would like to call it something like wallet journal
    - It will also generate a profile photo for you.
- Now go to configure
    - Change the conversation starters to something more relevant like
       - What is my wallet balance?
       - Log an expense of 10 dollars at walmart for groceries
       - Add 100 dollars as pocket money to my wallet
       - Give me my most recent transactions
       - Reset my wallet


### Configure Actions for your GPT

- Hit create new Action
- Authentication choose OAuth
    - Add your `client-id`, `client-secret` from your .env.default file
    - Add authorizationURL:
       `https://<your_cloudfunctions_base_url>/getAuthenticationURL`
    - Add tokenURL:
       `https://<your_cloudfunctions_base_url>/getTokensFromCode`
- Copy the contents of [schema.json](functions/reference_stuff/schema.json) and paste in the schema section
    - Replace `servers[0].url` to your cloudfunction base URL.
    - This schema tells GPT about all the available functionalities.
- Publish - only to me
    - Now you will be able to try out the GPT
